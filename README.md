CombatGraph Documentation (see full documentation here: https://lissa-games.gitbook.io/combat-graph/).

In the BeforeCombatGraph branch, you’ll find the original version of the project—before CombatGraph was integrated. It features simple attack detection and movement for both the player and the enemy.

In the AfterCombatGraph branch, you’ll see the same scene enhanced with several new features:

1) CombatGraph-driven mechanics

2) Player-usable sliders and floating damage numbers

3) A mana system and basic attack functionality

4) Various buffs applied to the combat system

Additionally, there’s a second scene where multiple enemies use the same CombatGraph setup but with different modifiers to vary their behaviors.
